      <description>We have the data for the 100 top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online.Â we will try to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using Python.
Full details and Implementation  Jupyter Notebook  Some of the interesting insights Average ratings by Males and Females varying across the genres Inferences: Sci-Fi appears to be the highest rated genre in the age group of U18 for both males and females.</description>

      <description>Data visualisation with the help of a case study. It enable us to understand how visualisation aids in solving business problems  Data Handling and Cleaning Techniques   Missing Values
 Dropping the rows containing the missing values Imputing the missing values Keep the missing values if they don&amp;rsquo;t affect the analysis    Incorrect Data Types
 Clean certain values Clean and convert an entire column    Sanity Checks: The data that we have needs to make sense and therefore we can perform certain sanity checks on them to ensure they are factually correct as well.</description>
